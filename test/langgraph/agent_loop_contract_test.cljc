(ns langgraph.agent-loop-contract-test
  "The promises `langgraph.agent-loop` makes to a host, one deftest each.

  `agent_loop_test.cljc` walks ONE happy path (two calls, both approved,
  both succeed) and checks the phases it passes through. That is the
  right shape for showing the loop works. It is the wrong shape for the
  reason this reducer exists, which is to refuse things: to hold a
  destructive call until a human approves it, to fail closed on a call
  whose risk nobody declared, to stop when a budget is spent, to reject
  an event that arrives in the wrong phase.

  Measured 2026-08-22 by mutating `agent_loop.cljc` against the suite as
  it then stood (48 tests / 172 assertions, green): SEVENTEEN mutations
  left it green. Among them — a call awaiting approval could be handed a
  `:tool/execute` effect anyway; a call with no `:tool/risk` could run
  without approval; a DENIED call could still be executed; `max-turns`
  could be removed entirely; the tool-call budget could stop accumulating
  across turns; tool results could stop being returned in call order
  (the docstring's one stated promise); a terminal state could accept
  further events. None of those is a corner case. They are the contract.

  So each deftest below pins one promise, names the literal rejection
  reason where there is one (a host dispatches on it), and is registered
  in the superproject's `scripts/maturity-loop/mutations.edn` against the
  exact mutation that it — and only it — turns red."
