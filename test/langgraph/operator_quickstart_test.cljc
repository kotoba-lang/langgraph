  The quickstart tells an operator four things that are NOT obvious from

;; §5.2's residual risk — that a claiming checkpointer still lets the

;; interleaving, so asserting a number would be flaky and asserting a
;; bound would be a tautology (both are the "gate that cannot fail"
;; failure mode). The risk is fully determined by two facts that ARE
;; pinned deterministically above: only mem-checkpointer claims
;; (which-checkpointers-claim), and any caller observing a :done thread
;; re-arms the gate (run*-is-one-tick-not-resume-to-completion). The
