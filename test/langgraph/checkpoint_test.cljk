(ns langgraph.checkpoint-test
  "The conformance suite for the `Checkpointer` protocol itself.

  `langgraph.checkpoint` declares a protocol and ships two
  implementations of it; two more live in sibling namespaces
  (`kg-checkpoint`, `kotoba-checkpoint`). Every other test in this repo
  drives ONE of them, through a graph run, and asserts what that run
  produced. That is the right shape for testing a graph. It is the wrong
  shape for testing a protocol: it pins each implementation against its
  own scenario, so a promise the protocol makes to ALL implementors ends
  up pinned wherever someone happened to write a scenario, and unpinned
  everywhere else.

  Measured 2026-08-21 by mutating `checkpoint.cljc` against the suite as
  it then stood (45 tests / 156 assertions, green): `get-state-at` could
  be changed to answer with a step it was not asked for, `mem`'s
  `-list-checkpoints` could lose its `sort-by :step`, and BOTH `-put!`
  implementations could stop returning the checkpoint — four mutations,
  no failures. The same three promises were already pinned elsewhere for
  the other implementors (`:langgraph/history-ascending` covers the
  Datomic sort; `kg-checkpoint-test/put-returns-ckpt` covers that
  return), which is the asymmetry itself: the contract was never wrong,
  it was just only ever checked on whichever implementation the last
  scenario happened to use.

  So each deftest here states one promise the protocol makes and runs it
  against EVERY checkpointer this namespace ships, from one body. A new
  implementation is added to `checkpointers` and inherits the contract
  rather than being trusted with it."

(defn- checkpointers
  "Fresh instances of every checkpointer `langgraph.checkpoint` ships,
  each behind the same protocol. Called per deftest so no test inherits
  another's rows.

  Deliberately NOT asserted anywhere below: `-get-latest` means
  different things to these two when steps are written out of order —
  `mem` peeks the last row WRITTEN, the Datomic one queries the highest
  `:step`. In-order writes (what `graph/run*` does) can't tell them
  apart. Picking a winner here would be inventing a contract the
  protocol does not state, so this suite pins what the protocol DOES
  state and leaves that difference visible for whoever needs to decide
  it."

(deftest get-state-at-answers-only-for-the-step-it-was-asked-for
  (testing "`get-state-at` is the time-travel read, and it is the one
            operation here whose caller has already decided which moment
            it wants: an audit asking what the thread looked like at the
            step a human approved, a replay pinned to a step. It scans
            the history with a predicate, and the predicate has to be
            equality. Relaxed to `<=` or `>=` it still returns a real,
            well-formed checkpoint — just a neighbouring one — so the
            caller cannot tell it was answered with a different moment
            than the one it named. That is worse than an error: the
            audit gets a state, believes it is step N, and the record
            says the thread was somewhere it never was.

            A step can be missing from a history that is otherwise fine:
            retention pruned the older rows, the history was restored
            from a partial export, or the caller simply named a step
            that does not exist. Every one of those must read as absent."

(deftest list-checkpoints-is-ascending-by-step-however-it-was-written
  (testing "`-list-checkpoints` is documented on the protocol as \"All
            checkpoints for the thread, ascending by :step\" — not \"in
            the order they arrived\". Both shipped implementations sort,
            but only the Datomic one's sort is pinned (mutation
            `:langgraph/history-ascending`); `mem`'s survives being
            deleted because nothing ever writes to it out of order.

            The order is not cosmetic. `get-state-at` above reads
            through this list and takes the FIRST match, and a caller
            reading a history to reconstruct what happened reads it top
            to bottom. Insertion order and step order are the same
            sequence for a graph running forward, which is exactly why
            this goes unnoticed until something writes out of order — a
            backfill, a replayed export, a host restoring a thread it
            had archived — and then the history is a plausible-looking
            narrative of a run that never happened in that order."

;; ── what put! hands back ─────────────────────────────────────────────

(deftest put!-returns-the-checkpoint-it-persisted
  (testing "`-put!`'s return is the protocol's, not an implementation
            detail: `kg-checkpoint-test/put-returns-ckpt` already pins it
            for the kg-backed one, and both implementations here return
            `ckpt` on purpose. Neither is checked, so either could start
            returning the transaction result, or nil, and only a caller
            that threads the value — `(-> ckpt (put! …) :step)`, a host
            echoing the persisted checkpoint back to its own caller —
            would find out, at runtime, in whatever process it was
            written into.

            Returning the checkpoint is also what makes `put!` safe to
            use in a pipeline at all, so this is the promise that decides
