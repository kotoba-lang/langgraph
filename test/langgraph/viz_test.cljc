  this proves it is a diagram Mermaid can parse.

  Node names here are Clojure keywords, so hyphens are the norm
  (:call-model, :run-tools) and `?`/`!` are ordinary — none of which is
  a Mermaid identifier. The id therefore has to be sanitised while the
  human-readable label keeps the name the graph actually uses; getting
  that backwards produces a diagram that either fails to render or
  renders under names nobody can grep for."
