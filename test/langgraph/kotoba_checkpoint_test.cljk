(defn- wire-elem
  "One attribute value, encoded the way kotobase-server's wildcard pull
  actually puts it on the wire: a STRING goes RAW (unquoted), every other
  type goes as its own `pr-str`. Confirmed against the live edge by
  `langchain.kotoba-db/decode-pull-value`, whose docstring records the
  measurement (2026-07-18) and the symbol guard it needs as a result.

  Kept faithful deliberately, but NOT currently load-bearing: mutating this
  to pr-str strings too was tried on 2026-08-19 and no test went red, because
  `->ckpt` reads back only step/state/frontier/status and none of those is a
  bare string attribute -- the raw-vs-pr-str distinction has no observable
  effect through this checkpointer. It would start mattering the moment
  something reads `:checkpoint/thread` back, or if upstream's symbol guard
  regressed (it did once, see that fn's docstring). Do not \"simplify\" this to
  a bare pr-str on the grounds that the suite stays green -- the suite staying
  green is exactly what this file got wrong before."

(defn- wildcard-result-edn
  "An entity map, encoded as the `:result_edn` a `[*]` pull returns:
  `{\":attr\" #{\"wire-value\"}}` -- keys are pr-str'd keywords, and EVERY
  value is set-wrapped regardless of Datomic cardinality.

  Three facts here were fiction in this mock until 2026-08-19, and each
  one was load-bearing:

    1. the request's `:entity` is a PLAIN string, never `pr-str`'d and
       never `edn/read-string`'d server-side -- this mock used to read it,
       which throws `Invalid token: thread-1/0` on the very key format
       `datomic-checkpointer` builds (`\"<thread>/<step>\"` is not a legal
       symbol);
    2. the response field is `:result_edn`; the live edge returns NO field
       named `entity_edn` from this NSID at all;
    3. values come back DECODED, so a pr-str'd `:checkpoint/state` arrives
       as a map, not as the EDN string it was written as.

  Because the mock agreed with an older client that was wrong in the same
  three ways, these tests were green against a protocol the server does
  not speak. Encoding the real shape here is what makes them mean
  anything -- see `langgraph.checkpoint/decode-edn-attr`."
