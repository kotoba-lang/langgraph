            is a where-clause rather than a data structure — which means
            it can be dropped without any type or arity complaining. The
            two reads have to stay scoped independently: -get-latest
            resolves a thread's OWN max step (an unscoped max would
            address a step that thread never reached), and
            -list-checkpoints returns that thread's rows alone.

            The threads below are deliberately at different depths, so
            an unscoped read lands somewhere visibly wrong instead of
            coincidentally right."

            the question an audit asks it.
