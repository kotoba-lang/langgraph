(ns langgraph.runner-coverage-test
  "Pins that `run-tests.cljs` — the nbb entry the fleet's `:nbb-test` gate
  runs — names every test namespace in this repo, or names why not.

  A runner listing a subset of the namespaces prints the same
  `N tests, N passed` line as one listing all of them; nothing in the
  output says what was left out. The runner's own comment promised
  \"every deftest-bearing portable namespace\" and said exactly ONE was
  excluded. Measured 2026-08-22: `checkpoint_test.cljc` had been landed
  the day after that runner, was in neither its require nor its
  `run-tests` call, and the nbb gate had been green for two days on
  36 tests while the JVM ran 48. Nobody misread anything; there was
  nothing to read.

  So this test derives the namespace set from the files on disk, reads
  the runner as text, and demands equality — from BOTH lists, because
  requiring registers the vars and only `run-tests` runs them. The one
  legitimate exclusion is declared here WITH its reason, and the reason
  is itself asserted: the day `kg_checkpoint.cljc` stops containing the
  double-slash keyword the cljs reader rejects, this test fails, saying
  the exclusion has expired and the namespace belongs in the runner.

  It runs on both runtimes and reads relative to the repo root, which is
  where `clojure -M:test` and the fleet's `npx nbb … run-tests.cljs` are
  both invoked."
