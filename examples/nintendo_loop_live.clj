(ns nintendo-loop-live
  "LIVE wiring of the Nintendo Loop (examples/nintendo_loop.cljc) against the REAL
   network-isekai game `gftd/yoro` — headless, no browser, no API key.

   The langgraph-clj graph is unchanged; only the injected host capabilities are real:

     :observe  → shells `node quality/observe.mjs <gameDir>` — compiles logic.clj → wasm with
                 kototama (in Node) and runs the deterministic playtester, returning objective
                 game‑feel scores + named defects as EDN. (The *visual test*, headless half.)
     :judge    → merges the harness scores with a static SFX audit of scene.edn. (The vision
                 dims — readability/juice/composition — are the documented Claude hook; this
                 live run uses the objective + audio rubric so it closes fully autonomously.)
     :reason   → a rule‑based critic: maps the worst harness defect to ONE concrete tuning
                 patch (e.g. 'jump too weak' → raise the `jump` constant). (Swap for a
                 create‑react‑agent + Claude to author free‑form edits.)
     :apply    → edits the game's logic.clj in place (with a content backup for rollback).
     :rollback → restores the backup (the graph's time‑travel branch).
