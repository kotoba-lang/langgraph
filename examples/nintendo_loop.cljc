  "The *Nintendo Loop* — a ReAct quality-improvement loop, in langgraph-clj.

   It treats a kami/EDN game (e.g. network-isekai `gftd/yoro`) as the *environment*
   and iterates  Observe → Judge → Gate → Reason → Act → Observe …  until every
   dimension of a measurable 'Nintendo bar' rubric is cleared (or a budget runs out).

   ReAct mapping:
     • Reason  = the `reason` node — an LLM critiques the weakest rubric dimension and
                 proposes ONE concrete, minimal, testable edit (a tool call / patch).
     • Act     = the `act` node — applies the patch to the game's EDN/CLJ, rebuilds, and
                 smoke-checks it (the patched logic still compiles to wasm, no soft-lock).
     • Observe = the `perceive` node — the *visual test*: it runs a deterministic wasm
                 playtester (objective game-feel metrics) AND captures real screenshots.
     • Judge   = the `evaluate` node — scores Observe against the rubric: harness metrics
                 give the objective dims, a vision model scores the visual dims from the
                 screenshots, and an SFX audit scores audio.
     • Gate    = a conditional edge — pass ⇒ END, regressed ⇒ rollback (checkpoint
                 time-travel), else ⇒ another Reason→Act iteration.

   The library does NO I/O (WASM premise). Everything that touches the world — the
   playtester, the browser screenshotter, the LLM, the file editor/builder — is an
   INJECTED host capability (`caps`). `-main` wires deterministic MOCK caps so the whole
   loop runs offline and you can watch the quality trajectory converge; the `(comment …)`
   at the bottom shows the real wiring (Claude vision + headless browser + the wasm
   playtest harness in network-isekai/quality/playtest_harness.mjs)."
