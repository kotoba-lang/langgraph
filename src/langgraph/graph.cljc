  "StateGraph — LangGraph-style graph orchestration in portable Clojure.

  Model:
    - shared state = a map
    - channels declare per-key reducers, e.g.
        {:messages {:reducer into :default []}}
      (default reducer = last-write-wins)
    - nodes are Runnables: state → partial state update map
    - edges are static, or conditional via a router fn
    - execution is a Pregel-style superstep loop with a recursion
      limit, optional checkpointing per superstep, and
      interrupt-before/after for human-in-the-loop

  Single-threaded by design (WASM premise): nodes in one superstep run
  sequentially in insertion order; their updates are folded through
  the channel reducers in that order."
