;; ───────────────────────── atomic resume claim (optional) ─────────────────────
;;
;; A SEPARATE, additive protocol -- not required of every Checkpointer --
;; so adding it can't break an existing implementation that doesn't (yet)
;; support it. Without this, resuming an :interrupted thread is a plain
;; read-then-act: langgraph.graph/run* reads the latest checkpoint, sees
;; :status :interrupted, and runs the gated (interrupt-before) node --
;; with NO synchronization between that read and the act of running the
;; node. Two (or more) concurrent resume calls on the SAME thread-id (a
;; realistic scenario: a retry, a double-click, a racing worker -- not a
;; contrived edge case) can all read the SAME :interrupted checkpoint and
;; all independently decide to resume, each running the gated node once
;; -- silently bypassing interrupt-before's entire purpose as a human-in-
;; the-loop safety gate. Confirmed empirically: 10 concurrent resume
;; calls on one thread-id ran the gated node 5 times instead of 1.
;;
;; ClaimableCheckpointer closes this for any backend that implements it:
;; langgraph.graph/run* checks `satisfies?` before resuming, and only
;; proceeds if the claim succeeds (or the checkpointer doesn't support
;; claiming at all, preserving the exact prior behavior for anyone not
;; yet on a claiming-capable checkpointer -- not a breaking change).

    other caller has already claimed/advanced this thread since) --
    and durably marks the claim in that same atomic step, so a
    concurrent racer's own claim attempt correctly loses. Returns
    false if the caller lost the race; the caller MUST NOT run the
